 - The EasyRent Software Description: 

You have been hired to develop a program software for a local Car Rental Company. Besides car
rental, the company also offers customers additional services such as a navigation system devices,
car seats, and full rental insurance.

The system you are requested to develop is called EasyRent and is expected assist the agent at the
company in processing car reservation and additional services requests. At the beginning, your
system will read the available cars information from inputCar.txt. Information read from
inputCar.txt are written with all the details into the car information file, called CarsInfo.txt.

After that, the system will be ready to process reservation requests! For each reservation request,
the cars’ information including customer information, pick up and drop off location and date, and
any services the customer would like to add are all read from the input file ReservationInput.txt.

After processing each reservation request, the status of this reservation, whether it was successful
or not, is written to the output file ReservationStatus.txt. If a reservation request is successful,
then an invoice will be generated and written to this file. Otherwise, an appropriate message is
displayed to show that the reservation was unsuccessful (Sorry! The requested car is not available).

At last, the system will generate a report file calculating the number of each requested service
according to each car type, which is written to the output file AnalysisReport.txt.
For a more detailed description of the system and commands, please follow the next four steps
which will explain how to develop the EasyRent System.
