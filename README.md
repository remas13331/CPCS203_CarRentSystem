 #### Assignment one in cpcs203 subject 
 ## Important concepts to implement this project :

##### - Objects and classes.
##### - Use File I/O (Reading/Writing from/to files).
##### - Use String class.
##### - 1D and 2D arrays.

 ## The Software Description: 

You have been hired to develop a program software for a local Car Rental Company. Besides car
rental, the company also offers customers additional services such as a navigation system devices,
car seats, and full rental insurance.

The system you are requested to develop is called EasyRent and is expected assist the agent at the
company in processing car reservation and additional services requests. At the beginning, your
system will read the available cars information from [Car Input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjXorneaDR02bD3Ka3WzOzP6zgYtBQ_r/view?usp=share_link) Information read from
[Car Input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjXorneaDR02bD3Ka3WzOzP6zgYtBQ_r/view?usp=share_link) are written with all the details into the car information file, called [Car Info](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W_BLIUXQGz9NAus-zJsFBppe9b6cEft4/view?usp=share_link) .

After that, the system will be ready to process reservation requests! For each reservation request,
the carsâ€™ information including customer information, pick up and drop off location and date, and
any services the customer would like to add are all read from the input file [Reservation Input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12V-_9I0UmMq52aC59A8zwsVm--wdQN84/view?usp=share_link) .

After processing each reservation request, the status of this reservation, whether it was successful
or not, is written to the output file [Reservation Status](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16YLPDk3FCOHEewn5PtaiQIGqWIdzQnVo/view?usp=share_link) . If a reservation request is successful,
then an invoice will be generated and written to this file. Otherwise, an appropriate message is
displayed to show that the reservation was unsuccessful (Sorry! The requested car is not available).

At last, the system will generate a report file calculating the number of each requested service
according to each car type, which is written to the output file [Analysis Repotr](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ar2VY_aZF8flR0-Sy2xkM_eMx99b5njm/view?usp=share_link) .
For a more detailed description of the system and commands, please follow the next four steps
which will explain how to develop the EasyRent System.

## Files provided with assignment :

### - Input file samples:
[Car Input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjXorneaDR02bD3Ka3WzOzP6zgYtBQ_r/view?usp=share_link) - which contains all Cars/Services information that needs to be entered
into the system.

[Reservation Input](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12V-_9I0UmMq52aC59A8zwsVm--wdQN84/view?usp=share_link) - contains all the commands for reservation requests. These
commands are read from the file and processed by the system.


### - Output files:
[Car Info](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W_BLIUXQGz9NAus-zJsFBppe9b6cEft4/view?usp=share_link) - A file that displays all the cars information in the system (The
information in this file is read from inputCar.txt).

[Reservation Status](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16YLPDk3FCOHEewn5PtaiQIGqWIdzQnVo/view?usp=share_link) - which contains a log of all processed reservations
including successful and unsuccessful reservation requests. For successful
reservation requests, a detailed invoice is included.

[Analysis Repotr](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ar2VY_aZF8flR0-Sy2xkM_eMx99b5njm/view?usp=share_link) - which contains a record of how many each car type had been
requested with each specific service.

## In The end ...
#### I may do some edits on the code to make it general and efficint, I did enjoy doing this assignment so much !
